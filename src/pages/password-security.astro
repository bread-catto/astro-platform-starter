Passwords are the keys to everything online. But how do attackers try to steal them, and what can you do to stay safe? Lets run through some types of attacks and what level of threat they actually pose.
`;

const bruteForce = `
### Brute Force Attack

A **Brute Force** attack is the most straightforward method hackers use. The attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters until they find the correct password.
As the students in my CTC class will know, a program called John The Ripper can run this type of attack, as long as the password hashes are present.

**How it works:**
- The attacker's program starts with "a", then "b", then "c"... all the way through every character
- Then it tries "aa", "ab", "ac"... and so on
- These types of programs use all available characters, lowercase, capital, numbers & special characters
- The cycle repeats until the correct password is found

**Why it's dangerous:** Given enough time and computing power, a brute force attack can crack any password. Short passwords (under 8 characters) can be cracked in minutes or hours.

**Real World Things** While I couldn't find many notable hacks that were attributed to brute force. I did however find that it was utilized in a 2014 iCloud attack. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Example:** For a 4-character password using only lowercase letters, there are 26^4 = 456,976 possible combinations. A modern computer can try all of these in seconds!
`;

const dictionaryAttack = `
### Dictionary Attack

A **Dictionary Attack** is smarter and more efficient than brute force. Instead of trying every combination, it uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords.

**How it works:**
- Attackers compile lists of common passwords like "password123", "qwerty", "letmein"
- Any data breach adds to lists available among hackers, these dictionaries are obscenely large
- The attack program tries each word in the given dictionary
- Variations are also tested: "Password", "PASSWORD", "p@ssword", "password1"

**Why it's dangerous:** Many people use common words or phrases with simple substitutions as passwords. Studies show that a large percentage of users have passwords that appear in common dictionary lists.

**Real-world impact:** The most common passwords like "123456" and "password" can be cracked in milliseconds.
`;

const passwordSpraying = `
### Password Spraying

**Password Spraying** is a bit different than other attacks. Instead of trying many passwords against one account, attackers try a few common passwords against many accounts.
This type of attack is often utilised when a system has timed lockouts on accounts, making brute force or dictionary attacks unfeasible.

**How it works:**
- The attacker gathers a list of usernames (often from data breaches or company directories)
- They try ONE common password (like "Summer2024!") against ALL accounts
- After waiting to avoid lockouts, they try the next common password

**Why it's dangerous:** This technique avoids account lockout protections that trigger after too many failed attempts on a single account. Organizations with thousands of users are especially vulnerable.

**Example scenario:** An attacker tries "CompanyName123!" against 10,000 employee accounts. Even if only 0.1% use that password, that's 10 compromised accounts!
`;

const rainbowTable = `
### Rainbow Table Attack

A **Rainbow Table** is a precomputed lookup table used to crack password hashes. Instead of hashing passwords during an attack, hackers use these tables to instantly look up the original password.

**Understanding password hashing:**
- When you create a password, websites store a "hash" (an encoded version) instead of the actual password
- Example: "mypassword" hashed with an MD5 checksum would become "af85cc356b8a0c36473856e35430065d"
- When you log in, your entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash

**How rainbow tables work:**
- Attackers precompute hashes for millions of possible passwords
- These tables get obscenely large, surpassing terrabytes of data on occasion
- When they steal a database of hashed passwords, they simply look up each hash in their table
- If found, they instantly know the original password

**Why it's dangerous:** Rainbow tables can crack simple passwords in seconds, even if the attacker only has the hashed version.

**Extra note:** These attacks operate offline, using no resources on the hacked machine. Only the data stored on it.

### Salting: The Defense Against Rainbow Tables

**Salting** is a security technique that inhibits rainbow table attacks by adding random data to each password before hashing.

**How salting works:**
1. When you create a password, the system generates a random string called a "salt"
2. The salt is combined with your password: "mypassword" + "x7Kp9" = "mypasswordx7Kp9"
3. This combined string is then hashed
4. The salt is stored alongside the hash (it's not secret)

**Why salting is effective:**
- Each user has a unique salt, so identical passwords produce different hashes
- Pre-computed rainbow tables become significantly less useful because they would need to account for every possible salt
- Attackers must crack each password individually, dramatically increasing the time required

\`\`\`
Without Salt:
  User A: "password123" → hash: abc123...
  User B: "password123" → hash: abc123... (same!)

With Salt:
  User A: "password123" + "salt1" → hash: xyz789...
  User B: "password123" + "salt2" → hash: def456... (different!)
\`\`\`

const mfaExplainer = `
### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access an account. Even if an attacker steals your password, they can't get in without the additional factors.

**The Four Factors of Authentication:**

1. **Something You Know** (Knowledge Factor)
   - Passwords, PINs, security questions
   - The most common but also most vulnerable factor

2. **Something You Have** (Possession Factor)
   - Your phone receiving an SMS code
   - Hardware security keys (like YubiKey :D)
   - Authenticator apps that generate time-based codes

3. **Something You Are** (Inherence Factor)
   - Fingerprint scans
   - Facial recognition
   - Retina or iris scans
   - Voice recognition

4. **Somewhere You Are** (Location Factor)
   - GPS location verification
   - Network-based location (checking if you're on a trusted network)
   - IP address verification

**Why MFA is powerful:** Using factors from different categories makes attacks exponentially harder. An attacker would need to steal your password AND your phone AND somehow fake your fingerprint!

### How to Protect Yourself

Follow these actionable tips to keep your accounts secure:

**Password Length and Complexity:**
- Use at least 12-16 characters minimum
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Consider using passphrases: "correct-horse-battery-staple" is stronger than "P@ssw0rd!"
- Longer passwords exponentially increase cracking time

**Avoid Password Reuse:**
- Never use the same password for multiple accounts
- If one site is breached, all your accounts become vulnerable
- Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords

**Enable MFA Everywhere:**
- Turn on multifactor authentication for all important accounts
- Prefer authenticator apps over SMS when possible
- Consider hardware security keys for critical accounts

**Stay Informed:**
- Check if your accounts have been breached at haveibeenpwned.com
- Update passwords immediately if a breach is reported
- Be suspicious of phishing attempts trying to steal your credentials
